implementation a:

pro: when we save the token locally, we avoid asking it from the server every time, which is an expensive request.
con: if we save the user token for reuse we are risking our users, because someone might get access to this token
and can use our user information. if we don't save the token it's less of a risk

implementation b:
pro: our information is more secured
cons: we need to connect with the server  for every request
